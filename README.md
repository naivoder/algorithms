# algorithms
Solutions to interesting problems, implementations of cool algorithms. Having fun with python :snake:

These solutions all use Python 3. 
Inspiration for these problems has come from many places, including but not limited to:

1) Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms - Miller and Radnum
2) Elements of Programming Interviews in Python - Aziz, Lee and Prakash
3) Programming Pearls - Bentley
4) Cracking the Coding Interview - McDowell
5) Learning Python - Lutz

I highly recommend all of these books.

### installation
If you clone this repository, I would advise adding the /algorithms/ directory to your python path at the command line:

1) `nano ~.local/lib/your-python-distro/site-packages/path.pth`
2) add line: "/path/to/your/algorithms"
